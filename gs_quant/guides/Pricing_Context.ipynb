    "\n",
    "There are two parameters of [`PricingContext`](https://developer.gs.com/docs/gsquant/api/classes/gs_quant.markets.PricingContext.html) which determine how the calculation call should be made: `is_async` and `is_batch`. There are several considerations when deciding what the preferred behavior is.\n",

    "\n",
    "`is_async` determines whether the request is processed asynchronously. This allows a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `False` (the default) the `__exit__` method of [`PricingContext`](https://developer.gs.com/docs/gsquant/api/classes/gs_quant.markets.PricingContext.html) will block until the results are returned. If `True`, it will return immediately and the user should check the status of the returned futures, or add a callback to them in order to handle results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `is_async=True` allows other work to be done while waiting for calculation results. It is best used for processing independent data; asynchronously updating records that are dependent or depended upon may lead to unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation requests are handled by HTTP calls. The gateway which processes these calls has a maximum timeout of 3 minutes.\n",
    "For calculations that are expected to last longer than 3 minutes, `is_batch` should be set to `True`.\n",
    "In this mode, the computation is run asynchronously on Goldman Sachs' servers and a thread is started to listen for the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "`is_batch` is independent of `is_async` and may be used with `is_async` set either to `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently `is_batch=True` adds a small overhead to calculations. This will be eliminated in the future, at which point we will likely to make all calculations execute this way, and eliminate the `is_batch` option.\n",
